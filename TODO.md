# Updater
- Function for creating a release package (zip)
- Function for running the installer creator?
- CLI for automating the creation of a new release which means creating a new Releases.toml, the update manifest, and all the above functions.
- Add function for setting/getting the Rainway version on the registry (we should update the one created by the installer)
- Make auto updating safe by using a rollback system:
- Add commandline arguments that make it easy to interface with the process from C#.
- Self-updating functionality for the actual bootstrapper
